This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an element beyond the vector's valid index range. This leads to undefined behavior, often manifesting as a segmentation fault or unexpected results. The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides the corrected code with the proper loop condition to avoid this error.
